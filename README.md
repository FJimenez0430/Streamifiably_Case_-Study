# Streamifiably_Case_-Study
I have been asked to conduct an analysis and develop an actionable plan based on data-driven decision making, supporting a front-end development team. 

Background:
You are working as an Insights Engineer for Streamifiably, a leading streaming TV platform. Streamifiably offers live TV channels, a vast library of on-demand content, and a personalized viewing experience for customers. As the Insights Engineer, you play a critical role in leveraging data analytics to drive product improvements and deliver exceptional value to users.

Task: 
The product team has handed off a set of analytics requirements in the form of user events and tests that need to be implemented by the development team. However, the developers are facing issues while implementing the events. Because of this, the developers are not able to reliably pass the tests. As the Insights Engineer, you need to work with the cross-functional team to resolve this issue and ensure the analytics implementation meets the business requirements.
